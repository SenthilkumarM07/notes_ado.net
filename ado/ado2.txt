ADO:
=====
->Its is a connected architecture
->It is used to connect all the database

Ado.Net:
==========
It is connected as well as disconnected architecture
It is a latest connection tool
It is used to connect all the database

Namespace:
===========
using.system.data.sqlclient;
using.system.data.oracleclient;
using.system.data.oledb;

Classes:
========
XXX connection->Used to establish and connect.
XXX command->Write and execute the command.

XXX DataReader
XXX DataAdapter(Both are used for retrieval from database)


Two ways:
==========
1.Default constructor
2.Parameterised Constructor


Syntax:
============
XXX connection obj=new XXXconnection();
obj.connectionstring="";
obj.open();


Example:
==========
Sqlconnection Con=new sqlconnection();
con.connectionstring="user id=sa;pwd=sql;data source=.;database=master";
con.open();

Parameterised Constructor:
===========================
XXX connection obj=new XXXconnection();
con.open();

Example:
==========
sqlconnection con=new sqlconnection("server=.;initial catalog=master;integrated security=true");
con.open();

Command Class:
==============

1.Create Object
2.Write a Command
3.Give a Connection
4.Parameter Using
5.Method Execution


Parameter Symbol:
================
Sqlclient=@Fieldname
OracleClient=:Fieldname
oledb=?

Methods:
==========
1.ExecuteNonQuery(Insert,Delete,Update)
2.ExecuteReader(Select)
3.ExecuteScalar(Aggregate Function)
4.Dispose(To Reuse the Object Name)


DataReader:
===========
-It is used to read data from database and it is a read and forward only connected oriented architecture during fetch the data form db.
-DB will fetch the data very fast when compared with dataset.
-Generally we will use Execute reader object to bind data to datareader.

DataAdapter:
==============
-It will acts as a bridge between dataset / datatable and database.
-this Obj-object is used to read data from DB and bind that data to dataset /datatable
-Adapter is a disconnected oriented Architecture.

DataSet:
======
-It is a disconnected oriented architecture that means there is no need to active Connections during work with datasets and it is a collection of datatables and relations between tables.
-It is used to hold multiple tables with data.
-You can select data from tables,create ,view based on table and ask child rows over relations.
-Also dataset provides you with rich features like saving data as xml and loading Xml data.

DataTable:
=============
-Datatable represents a single table in the database.
-It has rows and columns.
-There is no much difference between Dataset and datatable.
-Dataset is simply the collection of datatable.
